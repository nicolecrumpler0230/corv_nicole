# corv_nicole
A modified version of the Compact Objects Radial Velocities (corv) code used in my WDparams pipeline. The credit for the source code goes to Vedant Chandra, and you can view the original documentation [here](https://github.com/vedantchandra/corv). The WDparams repository contains a .yml environment file capable of setting up a conda environment to use this package.
